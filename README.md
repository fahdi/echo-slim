# Echo App

### How to

1. Download the repo zip or clone it.
2. Install composer packages in root `composer install`
3. Go into `/public/` folder. 
4. Run `php -S localhost:XXXX`  where XXXX is your port.
5. Send JSON Data to the API using `/echo/` for example if your port is `8987`, the URL would be http://localhost:8987/echo
6. It should return the same JSON sent by you.
7. As an added bonus, you should see the data in logs `/logs/log.txt`
8. Pretty useful for debugging eh?
